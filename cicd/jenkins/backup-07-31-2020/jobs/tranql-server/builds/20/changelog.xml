    Merging master to dev (#104)
    
    * Develop (#100)
    
    * Test for node id update in two responses sharing similar curies but different main ids.
    
    * when looking for main ids in equivalent ids using lists in inner loop takes quite the time, especially when grabbing everything
    from services like automat. minor tweak to use dict based lookups instead of looping through lists for edges and nodes when merging
    
    * if score is zero for an entry in score table , we can continue, no need to loop.
    
    * fix for Node id not being updated in answer bindings due to type mis-match
